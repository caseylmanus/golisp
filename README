# GOLISP

## What is it?
A crazy, rather foolish attempt at implementing a LISP dialect that works with Go runtime and standard library.  

### Why?
Why not?  

### Goal?
Be able to write a dialect of LISP and access all of the features of Go, including Go routines, channels, etc.

## Status
Not even remotely ready for anyone to care about.

Are you crazy?
